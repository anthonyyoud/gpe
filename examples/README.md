Before compiling for the first time
===================================
In each example directory, copy `ic.in.dist`, `parameters.in.dist`, and
`run.in.dist` to `ic.in`, `parameters.in`, and `run.in` respectively, before
compiling.

Also make sure that `Makefile.dist` in the top-level `src` directory is copied
to `Makefile` in the same directory.

If you want to make any changes to run parameters or compilation options, edit
the copied files, and leave the dist files unchanged.
