Before compiling for the first time
===================================
In each example directory, copy `ic.in.dist`, `parameters.in.dist`, and
`run.in.dist` to `ic.in`, `parameters.in`, and `run.in` respectively, before
compiling.

Also make sure that a suitable `Makefile.inc` file has been created in the
top-level `src` directory, by copying and editing one of the example include
files.

If you want to make any changes to run parameters or compilation options, edit
the copied files, and leave the dist files unchanged.
