The files in this directory come from various sources.  The IDL Vizit program
itself was written by Antony Mee while he was a PhD student in the School of
Mathematics & Statistics at Newcastle University.

The other IDL routines were written by developers involved with the Pencil Code
(http://www.nordita.org/software/pencil-code/), many of whom have also been
members of the School of Mathematics & Statistics in the past.
